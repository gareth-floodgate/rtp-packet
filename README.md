## Getting Started


### Maven dependancy

In order to use this library, simply include the maven dependancy as shown below.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.vidtec</groupId>
    <artifactId>rtp-packet</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```


## Features

The rtp-packet library incorporates the following features:

 - Builder style packet instance creation.
 - Reading packets from byte[], DatagramPacket
 - Writing packets to byte[], DatagramPacket
 
General properties of RTPPacket:

 - All packet objects are fully validated against RFC 3550 during instantiation
 - All packet objects are immutable
 - Getter methods to extract data points
 - Automatic handling of padding
 - Automatic handling of header extensions
   
General properties of RTCPPacket:

 - All packet objects are fully validated against RFC 3550 during instantiation
 - All packet objects are immutable
 - Getter methods to extract data points
 - Automatic handling of padding
 - Automatic handling of compound packets
   

## Usage - RTP

All packet creation and reading undergoes complete validation. It is not possible to create an RTP packet that is not valid according to spec.

## Creating RTP Packets

In order to create a packet by hand, you can use the builder pattern to create a packet.

```

final RTPPacket p = RTPPacket.builder()
					  .withMarker()
		 			  .withRequiredHeaderFields(<packet_type, <seq_num>, <ssrc>, <timestamp>)	
					  .withCsrcIdentifiers(... <csrcs> ...)
					  .withHeaderExtension(<profile>, <extension_header>)
					  .withPayload(<payload>)
					  .build();
					  
```

**NB:** The ```build()``` method will throw an ```IllegalArgumentException``` if any of the data supplied would lead to creating of an invalid packet (according to RFC 3550).



## Reading RTP Packets


To create a new packet from a ```byte[]```

```

final RTPPacket p = RTPPacket.fromByteArray(<byte_array>);

```

**NB:** This method will throw an ```IllegalArgumentException``` if any of the data supplied would lead to creating of an invalid packet (according to RFC 3550).


To create a new packet from a ```DatagramPacket```

```

final RTPPacket p = RTPPacket.fromDatagramPacket(<datagram_packet>);

```

**NB:** This method will throw an ```IllegalArgumentException``` if any of the data supplied would lead to creating of an invalid packet (according to RFC 3550).


## Writing RTP Packets



To create a new packet from a ```byte[]```

```

final RTPPacket p = RTPPacket.fromByteArray(<byte_array>);

```


To create a new packet from a ```DatagramPacket```

```

final RTPPacket p = RTPPacket.fromDatagramPacket(<datagram_packet>);

```

## Usage - RTCP

All packet creation and reading undergoes complete validation. It is not possible to create an RTCP packet that is not valid according to spec.

## Compound Packets

## Creating Compound Packets

In order to create a packet by hand, you can use the builder pattern to create a packet.

```

final RTCPPackets p = RTCPPackets.builder()
				.withPacket( ... <RTCPPackets> ... )								
				.build();
				
```
or the shorthand version
```

final RTCPPackets p = RTCPPackets.buildWithPackets( ... <RTCPPackets> ... );

```

## Reading Compound Packets


To create a new packet from a ```byte[]```

```

final RTCPPackets p = RTCPPackets.fromByteArray(<byte_array>);

```

**NB:** This method will throw an ```IllegalArgumentException``` if any of the data supplied would lead to creating of an invalid packet (according to RFC 3550).


To create a new packet from a ```DatagramPacket```

```

final RTCPPackets p = RTCPPackets.fromDatagramPacket(<datagram_packet>);

```

**NB:** This method will throw an ```IllegalArgumentException``` if any of the data supplied would lead to creating of an invalid packet (according to RFC 3550).


## Writing Compound Packets


To create a new packet from a ```byte[]```

```

final RTCPPackets p = RTCPPackets.fromByteArray(<byte_array>);

```


To create a new packet from a ```DatagramPacket```

```

final RTCPPackets p = RTCPPackets.fromDatagramPacket(<datagram_packet>);

```
